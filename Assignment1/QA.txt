3.2.2
  Q:  What info is being reported by the benchmark?
  A:  (This is purely obtained from checking out the output)
      1.Data of the Benchmark(Input and other default parameters)
      2.Multigrid matrices size and sparsity per levels: Operator and Interpolation Matrices
      2.1.  Operator complexity indicates how much memory is needed(if large then the matrix requires a lot of memory)

      3.Wallclock and CPU clock times for:
        -Setup Matrix and rhs
        -Preconditioned conjugate gradient Setup(PCG)
        -PCG Solve
      4.Final residual norm of the multigrid
      5.System Size * it / Solve Time
      **Additionally we can measure speedups with respect to different # of processes

  Q:  Which data is related to problem size, performance or correctness checks?
  A:  For problem size: input parameters: (nx_global, ny_global, nz_global) and others
      For performance:  clock and CPU times
      For correctness:  last residual norm

  Q:  Explain each of the metrics in the output that belong to performance
  A:

  Q:  Are any of the performance metrics compounded based on othersß
  A:

  Q:  Is this a weak or strong scaling benchmark? Explain.
  A:  //J:I think this is strong scaling since we are increasing the number of processes and changing the local problem size but fixing the global one.
      //J:Though I could be wrong );

  Q:  Do the provided Load Leveler scripts keep the problem size constant? Explain
  A: //Y: Each submission file has different problem size. However in this way we state sizes only for one process. If we summ sizes up we can see that the global size stays the same for every scenario and every number of processes
 //J:Like I said in the questions before it fixes the global problem size but changes the local one!
