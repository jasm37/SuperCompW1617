3.2.2
  Q:  What info is being reported by the benchmark?
  A:  (This is purely obtained from checking out the output)
      1.Data of the Benchmark(Input and other default parameters)
      2.Multigrid matrices size and sparsity per levels: Operator and Interpolation Matrices
      2.1.  Operator complexity indicates how much memory is needed(if large then the matrix requires a lot of memory)
      3.Wallclock and CPU clock times for:
        -Setup Matrix and rhs
        -Preconditioned conjugate gradient Setup(PCG)
        -PCG Solve
      4.Final residual norm of the multigrid
      5.System Size * it / Solve Time
      **Additionally we can measure speedups with respect to different # of processes

  Q:  Which data is related to problem size, performance or correctness checks?
  A:  For problem size: input parameters: (nx_global, ny_global, nz_global) and others
      For performance:  clock and CPU times
      For correctness:  last residual norm

  Q:  Explain each of the metrics in the output that belong to performance
  A:

  Q:  Are any of the performance metrics compounded based on others√ü
  A:

  Q:  Is this a weak or strong scaling benchmark? Explain.
  A:  //J:I think this is strong scaling since we are increasing the number of processes and changing the local problem size but fixing the global one.
      //J:Though I could be wrong );

  Q:  Do the provided Load Leveler scripts keep the problem size constant? Explain
  A:  //J:Like I said in the questions before it fixes the global problem size but changes the local one!
