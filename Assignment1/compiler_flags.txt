march=native	: uses machine native units to run program


floop-block	: perfroms loop blocking(tiling) so that each sub-block of the loop fits to the cache size

floop-interchange	: changes the order of the nested loops, helps for fitting cashe size

floop-strip-mine	: perfroms strip mining, same as blocking, but ains to fir vector sizes

funroll-loops	: urolls loops, including loop peeling; make or may not make faster

flto	: link-time optimizer; complicated; should make faster

//---------------------------------------------------------

xHost	: use best SIMD instuctions on local machine (close to march=native?)

ipo	: interprocedural optimization; does a lot of suff; should make faster
