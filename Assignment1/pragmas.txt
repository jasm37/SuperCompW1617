#pragma simd  : for each vector loops executes n scalar loop iterations

#pragma vector  : forces compiler to vectorize computations (loops)

#pragma ivdep : forces compilor to ignore vector dependencies (similiar to vector); think crefully and apply only if no dependencies or it is possible to exploit vectorisation

#pragma loop_count  : specifies number of loop iterations; forces to iterate despite what is in the loop statement
