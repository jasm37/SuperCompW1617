#pragma simd  : for each vector loops executes n scalar loop iterations

#pragma vector  : forces compiler to vectorize computations (loops)

#pragma ivdep : forces compilor to ignore vector dependencies (similiar to vector); think crefully and apply only if no dependencies or it is possible to exploit vectorisation

#pragma loop_count  : specifies number of loop iterations; forces to iterate despite what is in the loop statement

#pragma inline  : hints the compiler that we would like the call to be inline

#pragma noinline  : tells the compiler that the call should not be inlined

#pragma forceinline : the call should be inlined whenever possible for the compiler

#pragma unroll :  if written before a loop, unroll the loop completely unless unroll(n)

#pragma nounroll  : instructs not to unroll a loop

#pragma unroll_and_jam  : partially unrolls loops highes than the innermost and fuses/jams the the resulting loop

#pragma nofusion :  does not fuse loops

#pragma distribute_point  : Used to suggest the compiler to split the large loops into smaller ones
                            This is useful when vectorization cannot take place because of excessive register usage.
