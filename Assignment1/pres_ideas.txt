Ideas for the video-presentation

---- FIRST PART ? -----------------

-Explain a little about the AMG benchmark:
 https://codesign.llnl.gov/amg2013.php and the readme in the docs folder of AMG.

- intoduction to Laplce program : 
        we solve a Laplace problem for a cubic domain with (???) methods  
        
 - explanation about arguments for benchmark: we pass nu of discretesation dots in every dimensio to be spawned in each process  

show hybrid.2.sh quickly

---- SECOND PART ? ----------------

say about MPI ?

show output file and discuss QA: reported things, performance, weak scaling

show Makefile.include

(answer QA 3.2.2) gcc&icc flags, put numbers to presentation, combinations 2^n

say which flags and combinations we used: floop are not supprted, so size is reduced, left are: -flto, -funloop-unroll, - xHost,  -march=native 

what we get: -O3 -unroll and show time (line on presentaton)


---- THIRD PART ? --------------

say what pragmas do generally
how did we find bottleneck (show screenshot of code)
what did we choose: loops covered with flags, so tried out vectorisation

(answer QA 4.2.2): simd, vector, ivdep 

which pragma is chosen
improvement gained: line from output


---- FOURTH PART --------

say what we do (OPEN MP scalabilty)

show plot in pdf

(answer QA 5.1.2)

say: scalibility for pure MPI

(answer QA 5.2.2)

say : hybrid MPI+OpenMP

(answer QA 5.3.2)


-Make excel tables and different graphics with setup and solve times for each case(# processes and threads)
