Ideas for the video-presentation

---- FIRST PART ? -----------------

-Explain a little about the AMG benchmark:
 https://codesign.llnl.gov/amg2013.php and the readme in the docs folder of AMG.

- intoduction to Laplce program : 
        we solve a Laplace problem for a cubic domain with (???) methods  
        
 - explanation about arguments for benchmark: we pass nu of discretesation dots in every dimensio to be spawned in each process  


---- SECOND PART ? ----------------

say about MPI

show mpi.2.sh quickly
show output file and discuss QA: reported things, performance, weak scaling

show Makefile.include
discuss QA: gcc&icc flags, combinations
say which flags and combinations we used: floop are not supprted, so size is reduced
what we get: -o3 -unroll and show time 


---- THIRD PART ? --------------

say what pragmas do generally
how did we find bottleneck
what did we choose: loops covered with flags, so tried out vectorisation
discus QA: simd, vector, ivdep
chosen what? 
improvement gained


-Make excel tables and different graphics with setup and solve times for each case(# processes and threads)
