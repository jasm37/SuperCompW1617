VIDEO COMMENTARY
  3.2 Provided Baseline
    Discuss:
    1.  Gaussian Elim.
    2.  Changes done in Load Leveler batch script
    3.  Challenges to get accurate baseline time in GE
    4.  Computation and MPI scalability fixed/changing process count and fixed/changing input set

  4.2 MPI Point-to-Point Communication
    1.  Which non-blocking operations were used?
    2.  Was communication and computation overlap achieved?
    3.  Was a speedup observed versus baseline?

  5.2 MPI One-Sided Comm.
    1.  Which one-sided op. were used?
    2.  Was comm. and computation overlap achieved?(how?)
    3.  Was speedup observed versus baseline?
    4.  Was speedup observed versus non-blocking version?
