Last assignment ;)

2.1 Submit updated GE with collective commands
2.2 Questions:
    1.  Which patterns were identified and replaced with collective communication?

    2.  Were you able to identify any potential for overlap and used any non-blocking collectives?

    3.  Was there any measurable performance or scalability improvement as a result of these changes√ü

    4.  Is the resulting code easier to understand and maintain after the changes? Why?

3.1 Submit updated GE with IO commands
3.2 Questions:
    1.  Which MPI-IO operations were applied to transform the code? Explain choices

    2.  What is "Data-Sieving" and "2 Phase IO"? How do they help improve IO performance?

    3.  Was the original implementation scalable in terms of IO performance?

    4.  Was the original implementation scalable in terms of RAM storage?

    5.  How much of the communication in the application was replaced or eliminated with MPI IO?

    6.  Were there any performance improvements due to the change to MPI-IO?
